        These buttery biscuits get a light hint of sweetness from added honey.
        Serve them warm, with additional honey, jam, or whatever you like on
        your biscuits.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
          <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
          <li>1/2 cup cold butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
          <li>3/4 cup cold buttermilk</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
          with parchment paper.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <p>
          Stir together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut in butter
          using a pastry blender or two forks until mixture resembles coarse
          crumbs.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <p>
          Stir honey and buttermilk together in a cup. Pour into flour mixture
          and stir until mixture comes together.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 4</h5>
        <p>
          Turn mixture out onto a lightly-floured work surface. Press dough into
          a rectangle shape about 1/2 inch thick. Fold mixture into thirds, like
          a letter, then turn 90 degrees and press again into a 1/2-inch thick
          rectangle. Fold dough into thirds again, turn 90 degrees, and press
          into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Fold dough into thirds one more time,
          and now press into a thicker rectangle, about 1-inch thick.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 5</h5>
        <p>
          Cut biscuits with a 2-inch round cookie cutter. Place biscuits onto
          the prepared baking sheet about 1 inch apart. Gently press remaining
          dough back together and cut biscuits; place onto the baking sheet.
          Press together any remaining dough scraps to form final biscuits.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 5</h5>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits begin to turn golden, 13 to
          15 minutes. Cool on a rack for a few minutes before serving.
        </p>
        <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
        <p>
          For an even sweeter biscuit, you can add up to 1/4 cup honey to the
          dough. You can also use up to 1 teaspoon kosher salt for a slightly
          saltier biscuit. This recipe makes about 10 biscuits using a 2-inch
          cutter, but will make more or fewer depending on the size cutter you
          use.
